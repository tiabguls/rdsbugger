This is a very poorly written, janky tool that I wrote in '99 or '00. I had just learned C, and this was one of the first ten functional programs I wrote.

Yes, it's terrible. Yes, it worked... and it got me into some ridiculous places all the way through 2003.

Thanks to Thomas Lopatic for introducing me to debug.exe

Thanks to humble for keeping me humble.
